**The Wyrnlands â€” Technical Design Document (Browser-First with SQLite)**

---

## âœ¨ Project Overview
The Wyrnlands is a medieval life-simulation RPG built for the browser using **Phaser.js** and **SQLite via sql.js**. The game simulates dynamic NPCs, household economies, tile-based construction, travel, social systems, and property ownership. The simulation is entirely local and persistent using an exportable SQLite database.
